This quickstart shows you how to set up, preview, and go live with an AI-editable Helium paywall in your app.

## Create your account on Helium

Create your Helium account at [app.tryhelium.com](https://app.tryhelium.com). 

This will take you to the *Dashboard*, where you can create paywalls, manage api keys and integrations, run a/b tests, view analytics, and more.

We'll start off in the **paywall editor**

## Connect your products from app store

Lets start by importing products from the app store. 

1. Go to [app.tryhelium.com/products](**Products**)
2. Click **Connect App Store** 
3. Enter your App Store Connect credentials to continue. Check out

Your products will now be available to use in any paywall you create.

<Note>
  Do this step even if you're using RevenueCat, your products will still be in Apple app store. Direct RevenueCat and Google Play import coming soon!
</Note>

## Create a new paywall

Time to create your first paywall with Helium!

1. Navigate to **Paywalls** in your dashboard

2. Click **Create New Paywall**. You can create a paywall
1) From a screenshot (recommended) 
2) From a template

3. Choose from a template or start from scratch
4. Use the visual editor to customize:
   
5. Save your paywall with a descriptive name

<Note>
  Helium's AI can help generate and optimize your paywall copy. Just describe what you want and let the AI assist you.

Basic setup involves:
1. Installing the Helium SDK package
2. Initializing with your API key
3. Setting up your payment delegate
4. Adding paywall triggers to your app

Example for iOS:
```swift
import Helium

// Initialize Helium
Helium.shared.initialize(
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    heliumPaywallDelegate: YourPaywallDelegate()
)

// Show a paywall
Helium.shared.presentUpsell(trigger: "onboarding")
```

## Set up revenue reporting so Helium can automatically optimize your revenue

Configure revenue tracking to enable Helium's automatic optimization:

1. Go to **Revenue Settings** in your dashboard
2. Choose your integration method:
   - **App Store Server Notifications** (recommended for StoreKit)
   - **RevenueCat Webhooks** (if using RevenueCat)
   - **Forward ASSN** (if you already consume webhooks)
3. Follow the setup instructions for your chosen method
4. Verify webhook delivery in the testing section

<Info>
  Revenue reporting enables Helium to track conversion rates, optimize paywalls, and provide detailed analytics about your subscription performance.

## Pre-launch and go live!

Before going live, make sure everything is working:

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test paywall display on different triggers
- [ ] Verify purchase flow works correctly
- [ ] Check fallback paywalls for offline scenarios
- [ ] Test on different device sizes
- [ ] Verify analytics events are firing

### Going Live
1. Enable your paywall in the Helium dashboard
2. Set up your experiment parameters (if running A/B tests)
3. Deploy your app update
4. Monitor performance in real-time through the dashboard

<Tip>
  Start with a small percentage of users if you want to test carefully, then ramp up as you gain confidence.
</Tip>

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You now have a live, AI-optimized paywall in your app. Monitor your dashboard for insights and let Helium's AI continuously optimize for better conversion.
