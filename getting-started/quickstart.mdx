This quickstart shows you how to set up, preview, and go live with an AI-editable Helium paywall in your app.

## Create your account on Helium

Create your Helium account at [app.tryhelium.com](https://app.tryhelium.com).

This will take you to the **Helium dashboard**, where you can create paywalls, manage api keys and integrations, run A/B tests, view analytics, and more.

## Connect your products

Visit [Integrations → Products](https://app.tryhelium.com/integrations/products) and sync your products from the App Store and/or Google Play store.

## Create a new paywall

1. Click on the **Paywalls** tab in the sidebar (or go [here](https://app.tryhelium.com/paywalls)).
2. Click **New Paywall** and complete that flow

   <Note>
     You can swap products in and out as desired. Just remember to have your products linked in the paywall before going live!
   </Note>

## Create a workflow and trigger(s)

Once you have published a pawyall, visit [Workflows](https://app.tryhelium.com/workflows) to create your first workflow. Once created, add a **trigger**.

**Triggers** are what you use in your app to determine which workflow (and its associated paywall/s) to show to a user.

A **workflow** is a configuration of trigger(s) that should point to the same paywall, or that share the same targeting or experimentation setup.

## Install and set up the SDK

Choose your mobile platform and follow the integration quickstart:

## Set up revenue reporting

Follow our [guide on revenue reporting](https://docs.tryhelium.com/guides/revenue-reporting) to connect Helium to your app's revenue events via webhooks.

<Tip>
  Revenue reporting enables Helium to provide detailed analytics about your app's monetization. It's a _must_ to get the most out of Helium!
</Tip>

## Set up fallbacks to guarantee 100% paywall uptime for your users

Follow our [guide on fallbacks](https://docs.tryhelium.com/guides/fallback-bundle) to guarantee that you'll have 100% uptime of your paywalls even if a user doesn't have a network connection.

## Pre-launch and go live!

Before going live, here's a quick checklist. As always, reach out via your Helium slack channel or to [founders@tryhelium.com](mailto:founders@tryhelium.com) if you'd like any help with testing.

### Testing Checklist

- Paywall created with products
- Workflow + trigger created
- SDK set up and paywall displays
- Purchases can be completed from your paywall(s)
- [Fallbacks](/guides/fallback-bundle) are configured

🎉 Congratulations! You now have a live Helium paywall and are ready to take your app's monetization to new heights!
