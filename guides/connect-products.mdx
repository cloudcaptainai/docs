Products represent different possible purchases within your app. App 

## Connect your app store

Go to the **Products** page in your dashboard and click the **Connect App Store** button:

![Download Fallbacks 1 Pn](/images/download_fallbacks_1.png)

Click that to open a dialog and select which control paywalls you would like to include as fallback for their corresponding trigger.

<Tip>
  If you update these paywalls (or add new ones) then you might consider doing this process again to get a newer fallback bundle.
</Tip>

Download the file. It should be named something like **fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json** where the **x** 's are replaced with today's date.

## Pass Fallback Bundle to Helium SDK

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [iOS Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-ios) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded bundle into the Project navigator of your Xcode project.
    3. You should see a dialog with **Action** and \*\*Targets \*\*fields. For **Action**, either option (copy or move) is fine. For \*\*Targets \*\*ensure that your app's main target is selected.
    4. Then pass the bundle URL to `Helium.initialize`

    ```swift
    let fallbackBundleURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx", withExtension: "json")

    Helium.shared.initialize(
       apiKey: apiKey,
       heliumPaywallDelegate: delegate,
       // ... other parameters ...
       fallbackBundleURL: fallbackBundleURL
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to replace **fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx** with the correct name\!
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [React Native Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-react-native) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded bundle into your React Native project where desired.
    3. Pass in to `Helium.initialize`

    ```typescript
    const fallbackBundle = require('./assets/fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json');

    initialize(
      apiKey: apiKey,
      // ... other parameters ...
      fallbackBundle: fallbackBundle,
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to use the correct path and filename in your `require` call\!
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Flutter">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [Flutter Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-flutter) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded bundle into your Flutter project where desired.
    3. In your `pubspec.yaml` add the new asset:

    ```yaml
    assets:
      - .env
      - fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json # add this line
    ```

    4. Pass in to `Helium.initialize`

    ```dart
    heliumFlutter.initialize(
      // ... other parameters ...
      fallbackBundleAssetPath: "fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json"
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to use the correct filename in both `pubspec.yaml` and the call to `initialize`\!
    </Note>
  </Tab>

All done\! If you want to test the fallback bundle, you can run your app with device in airplane mode and attempt to show a paywall. The corresponding fallback paywall should display\!
