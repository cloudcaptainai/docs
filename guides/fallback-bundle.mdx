## What are "fallbacks"?

The Helium SDK does its best to fetch the latest paywalls to display in your app. But if for some reason a paywall is not available — perhaps if an app user temporarily did not have a data connection — Helium will attempt to show a "fallback".

You can download copies of your actual Helium paywalls and include that in your app to use in the rare case that a Helium paywall is not ready for display.

## Download Fallbacks

Go to the [Workflows](https://app.tryhelium.com/workflows) page in your dashboard and find the **Download Fallbacks** button:

![Download Fallbacks 1 Pn](/images/download_fallbacks_1.png)

This will open a dialog and allow you to select which paywall/s to use as fallback.

After selection, click **Download** and your browser should download a file named **helium-fallbacks.json**.

<Tip>
  Whenever you update paywalls consider whether you want to repeat this process to update your fallbacks.

## Add fallbacks to your Helium SDK integration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [iOS Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-ios) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded file into the Project navigator of your Xcode project.
    3. You should see a dialog with **Action** and **Targets** fields. For **Action**, select your preference between the move and copy options. For **Targets** ensure that your app's main target is selected.
    4. That's it! The SDK automatically detects any file with the name `helium-fallbacks.json`.

    <Tip>
      To use a custom file name, set it before calling `initialize()`:

      ```swift
      Helium.config.customFallbacksURL = Bundle.main.url(
          forResource: "fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx",
          withExtension: "json"
      )
      ```
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [Android Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-android) if you haven't done so already.
    2. In your app's `src/main` directory, create an `assets` folder if one doesn't already exist.
    3. Drag your downloaded bundle into the `assets` folder.
    4. That's it! The SDK automatically detects `helium-fallbacks.json` in your assets.

    <Tip>
      To use a custom file name, set it before calling `initialize()`:

      ```kotlin
      Helium.config.customFallbacksFileName = "fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json"
      ```
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [React Native Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-react-native) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded bundle into your React Native project where desired.
    3. Pass in to `Helium.initialize`

    ```typescript
    const fallbackBundle = require('./assets/fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json');

    initialize(
      apiKey: apiKey,
      // ... other parameters ...
      fallbackBundle: fallbackBundle,
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to use the correct path and filename in your `require` call!
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Flutter">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [Flutter Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-flutter) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded bundle into your Flutter project where desired.
    3. In your `pubspec.yaml` add the new asset:

    ```yaml
    assets:
      - .env
      - fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json # add this line
    ```

    4. Pass in to `Helium.initialize`

    ```dart
    heliumFlutter.initialize(
      // ... other parameters ...
      fallbackBundleAssetPath: "fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json"
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to use the correct filename in both `pubspec.yaml` and the call to `initialize`!
    </Note>

## Testing Fallbacks

In version 4+ of the SDKs, look at your log output when running a test build to see if fallbacks are successfully loaded.

You can also run your app in airplane mode and then attempt to show your paywall, or show your paywall with a non-existent trigger.

## How to Monitor and Minimize Fallback Rate

You can check your app's fallback rate by going to your [Metrics page](https://app.tryhelium.com/metrics) and clicking on the "Fallback Rate" tab under Monitoring. This rate shows the # of fallback paywall opens vs prod paywall opens. If you notice your fallback rate is higher than expected, here are some tips on minimizing it:

- **Move your initialize() call earlier in your app's lifecycle.** We recommend right after app launch.
- **Set a higher loading budget.** If your paywall is still downloading when presented, Helium will show a loading state. The default loading budget of 7 seconds is generally plenty of time to ensure your paywall will show before fallback is used. But if you have overridden the budget to be a lower value, consider increasing it.
- **Reduce the size of image assets in your paywall.** We recommend keeping each paywall to be under about 3-5 MB in total size. If you're adding high resolution imagery to your paywall (which is fine!) we recommend converting images to .webp format - e.g. with an online converter like https://cloudconvert.com/webp-converter.

If you still see a rate higher than expected, please get in touch!
