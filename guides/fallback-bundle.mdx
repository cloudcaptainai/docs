## What is a "fallback bundle"?

The Helium SDK does its best to fetch the latest paywalls to display in your app. But if for some reason a paywall is not available — perhaps if an app user temporarily did not have a data connection — Helium will attempt to show a "fallback".

By using a fallback bundle you can download copies of your actual Helium paywalls and include that in your app to use in the rare case that a Helium paywall is not ready for display.

## Download Fallback Bundle

Go to the **Workflows** page in your dashboard and find the **Download Fallbacks** button:

![Download Fallbacks 1 Pn](/images/download_fallbacks_1.png)

Click that to open a dialog and select which control paywalls you would like to include as fallback for their corresponding trigger.

<Tip>
  If you update these paywalls (or add new ones) then you might consider doing this process again to get a newer fallback bundle.
</Tip>

Download the file. It should be named something like **fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json** where the **x** 's are replaced with today's date.

## Pass Fallback Bundle to Helium SDK

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [iOS Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-ios) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded bundle into the Project navigator of your Xcode project.
    3. You should see a dialog with **Action** and \*\*Targets \*\*fields. For **Action**, either option (copy or move) is fine. For \*\*Targets \*\*ensure that your app's main target is selected.
    4. Then pass the bundle URL to `Helium.initialize`

    ```swift
    let fallbackBundleURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx", withExtension: "json")
    
    Helium.shared.initialize(
       apiKey: apiKey,
       heliumPaywallDelegate: delegate,
       // ... other parameters ...
       fallbackConfig: HeliumFallbackConfig.withFallbackBundle(fallbackBundleURL)
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to replace **fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx** with the correct name\!
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [Android Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-android) if you haven't done so already.
    2. In your app's `src/main` directory, create an `assets` folder if one doesn't already exist.
    3. Drag your downloaded bundle into the `assets` folder.
    4. Create a `HeliumFallbackConfig` with the bundle file name and pass it to `Helium.initialize`

    ```kotlin
    Helium.initialize(
        context = applicationContext,
        apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY",
        heliumPaywallDelegate = yourDelegate,
        // ... other parameters ...
        fallbackConfig = HeliumFallbackConfig.withFallbackBundle(fallbackBundleName = "fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json"),
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to replace **fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx** with the correct name!
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [React Native Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-react-native) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded bundle into your React Native project where desired.
    3. Pass in to `Helium.initialize`

    ```typescript
    const fallbackBundle = require('./assets/fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json');
    
    initialize(
      apiKey: apiKey,
      // ... other parameters ...
      fallbackBundle: fallbackBundle,
    )
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to use the correct path and filename in your `require` call\!
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Flutter">
    1. Integrate the SDK with the [Flutter Quickstart](/sdk/quickstart-flutter) if you haven't done so already.
    2. Drag your downloaded bundle into your Flutter project where desired.
    3. In your `pubspec.yaml` add the new asset:

    ```yaml
    assets:
      - .env
      - fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json # add this line
    ```

    4. Pass in to `Helium.initialize`

    ```dart
    heliumFlutter.initialize(
      // ... other parameters ...
      fallbackBundleAssetPath: "fallback-bundle-xxxx-xx-xx.json"
    ```

    <Note>
      Make sure to use the correct filename in both `pubspec.yaml` and the call to `initialize`\!
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

All done\! If you want to test the fallback bundle, you can run your app with device in airplane mode and attempt to show a paywall. The corresponding fallback paywall should display\!

## How to Monitor and Minimize Fallback Rate

You can check your app's fallback rate by going to [https://app.tryhelium.com/metrics](https://app.tryhelium.com/metrics), and clicking on the "Fallback Rate" tab under Monitoring. This rate shows the # of fallback paywall opens vs prod paywall opens. If you notice your fallback rate is substantially high, here are some tips on minimizing it:

- **Set a higher loading budget (requires Helium SDK 3.0.0+).** If a paywall is opened while a download is still in progress, Helium will show a shimmer for *loadingBudget* seconds while waiting for the download to finish, before falling back. Simply increasing this value can basically eliminate most cases of fallbacks safe - we recommend < 5 seconds.

- **Move your initialize() call earlier in your app's lifecycle.** We recommend right after app launch, or right after onboarding with a higher loading budget.

- **Reduce the size of image assets in your paywall.** We recommend keeping each paywall to be under about 3-5 MB in total size. If you're adding high resolution imagery to your paywall (which is fine!) we recommend converting images to .webp format - e.g. with an online converter like [https://cloudconvert.com/webp-converter](https://cloudconvert.com/webp-converter).

If these aren't options for you (for example, if you have a lot of paywalls) and the above aren't helpful, please get in touch! We'll be happy to build a custom solution or server for you to ensure your fallback rate is low and your paywall $ rate is high.
