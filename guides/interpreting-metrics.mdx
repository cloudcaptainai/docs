Use Helium's paywall and revenue metrics to monitor your app's revenue, monitor paywall performance, and drive growth with paywall tests.

## Metrics

You can view metrics in 2 places in Helium's dashboard.

In the <a href="https://app.tryhelium.com/metrics" target="_blank">**Metrics Page**</a>, you can see overall metrics for your app, across all placements and experiments.

<Info>
  Make sure to [set up revenue reporting](https://docs.tryhelium.com/guides/revenue-reporting) to see Revenue and Subscription Metrics.

In the <a href="https://app.tryhelium.com/experiments" target="_blank">**Experiment Results Page**</a>, you can view experiment specific metrics. Scan the "at a glance" table section in the experiment results page to see general information on metrics, or look at the embedded charts for more detail on how metrics change over days.

## List of Metrics

### Revenue Metrics

#### Revenue

Total Revenue (purchases + subscription events - refunds) from all transactions in the given time period.

Calculated as: sum of all revenue events in the period.

This metric answers: "How much total revenue came in during this timeframe?"

This revenue is pre-tax and may be discounted further with taxes/commissions. Select "Helium Attributed" to see revenue attributed to purchases on Helium paywalls.

#### Realized Overall LTV Per User

Calculated as: Total revenue (purchases + subscription events - refunds) / total # of unique users.

This metric answers: "How much revenue have users acquired on Day X generated in total since then?"

Cohorted by the date the user was first seen by Helium. Does not include pending trial conversions. Use the Customer Lifetime selector to choose how much time after a user was first seen to attribute revenue.

#### Realized Overall LTV Per Paying User

Calculated as: Total revenue / unique users who made at least one purchase.

Unlike ARPU (which includes free users), this focuses on the spending power of converted users.

This metric answers: "How much do paying customers actually spend?"

Cohorted by the date the user was first seen by Helium. Does not include pending trial conversions.

### Paywall Metrics

#### Conversion Rate

Calculated as: (Users who converted / Total users) × 100.

Unlike Open to Conversion Rate (which counts every view), this counts each person only once regardless of how many times they saw a paywall.

This metric answers: "What percentage of my users are converting?"

#### Paywall Opens

Counts the number of paywall views in a certain period.

This metric answers: "How often are users seeing my paywalls?"

Segment by trigger to see how often certain triggers are getting viewed.

#### Open to Conversion Rate

Calculated as: (Sessions with conversion / Total paywall sessions) × 100.

This metric answers: "How effective is my paywall at converting each view?"

Compare to Conversion Rate to see the impact of repeated paywall opens on conversions.

#### Checkout Conversion Rate

Calculated as: (Successful purchases / Total purchase button taps) × 100.

This metric answers: "How often do users complete payment after tapping subscribe?"

Note: This is approximate, as not all button presses trigger payment sheets. A low rate suggests issues with the payment flow (e.g., declined cards) rather than paywall design.

#### Total Paywall Conversions

Counts the absolute number of paywall sessions that resulted in a purchase or trial start.

This metric answers: "How many conversions are my paywalls generating?"

Unlike Conversion Rate (a percentage), this tracks raw conversion volume.

### Subscription Metrics

#### New Subscriptions

Counts subscriptions that processed their first payment during the period. Includes direct purchases and trial conversions.

This metric answers: "How many new paying subscribers did I get?"

Note: This shows when revenue starts, not necessarily when the user signed up. Doesn't count consumables/IAP purchases.

#### New Trials

Counts unique free trials started during the period.

This metric answers: "How many users are starting trials?"

#### Trial Conversion Rate

Calculated as: (Converted trials / Total trials started) × 100.

Cohorted by trial start date, not payment date.

This metric answers: "How effective are my trials at converting to paid?"

If you see high trial starts but low conversion, consider adjusting price/duration or testing trial notification toggles.

#### Trial Cancellations

Counts trials cancelled before making a payment.

This metric answers: "How many users are churning during the trial window?"

Cohorted by cancellation date.

### Monitoring and User Metrics

#### Fallback Rate

Calculated as: (Fallback sessions / Total paywall sessions) × 100.

This metric answers: "How often is the paywall failing to load?"

A high rate typically indicates network issues, configuration errors, or SDK integration problems.

#### Active Users

Counts unique users who performed at least one event.

This metric answers: "How many users are actively engaging with my app?"

Helium tracks users by App Install, linking anonymous logins to users by default.
