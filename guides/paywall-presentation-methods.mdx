title: Alternative Paywall Presentation Methods
description: Advanced and alternative ways to present Helium paywalls beyond the standard presentUpsell method
---

## Overview

Most of the time you'll want to use **`presentUpsell()`** to show paywalls—it's covered in each platform's quickstart guide. But if you need more control over how and where paywalls appear in your app, there are a few other options.

<Warning>
You'll need to handle loading states, fallback scenarios, and dismissal logic yourself with these methods. We recommend sticking with `presentUpsell()` unless you have a specific reason to use these alternatives.
</Warning>

## iOS: SwiftUI ViewModifier

Attach a paywall to any SwiftUI view using the **`.triggerUpsell`** view modifier:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isPresented: Bool = false
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button {
                isPresented = true;
            } label: {
                Text("Show paywall")
            }

        }.triggerUpsell(isPresented: $isPresented, trigger: "post_onboarding")
    }
}
```

You can also pass in event handlers:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isPresented: Bool = false
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button {
                isPresented = true;
            } label: {
                Text("Show paywall")
            }
        }
        .triggerUpsell(
            isPresented: $isPresented,
            trigger: "post_onboarding",
            eventHandlers: PaywallEventHandlers()
                .onOpen { event in
                    print("open via trigger \(event.triggerName)")
                }
                .onClose { event in
                    print("close for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
                }
                .onDismissed { event in
                    print("dismiss for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
                }
                .onPurchaseSucceeded { event in
                    print("purchase made for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
                }
                .onCustomPaywallAction { event in
                    print("Custom action: \(event.actionName) with params: \(event.params)")
                }
        )
    }
}
```

## iOS: Explicitly Embedded View

Get the paywall view directly and embed it in your own view hierarchy using **`Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger`**:

```swift
let heliumView: AnyView? = Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger(
    trigger: "post_onboarding"
)
```

<Warning>
You'll need to handle presentation and dismissal yourself when using this method. Use PaywallEventHandlers to handle dismissal.
</Warning>

You can pass in event handlers here too:

```swift
Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger(
    trigger: "post_onboarding",
    eventHandlers: PaywallEventHandlers()
        .onOpen { event in
            print("open for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
        }
        .onClose { event in
            print("close for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
        }
        .onDismissed { event in
            // handle user dismissal here (i.e. hide the upsell view)
            print("dismiss for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
        }
        .onPurchaseSucceeded { event in
            print("purchase made for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
        }
        .onCustomPaywallAction { event in
            print("Custom action: \(event.actionName) with params: \(event.params)")
        }
)
```

## Flutter: Widget Integration

Embed a paywall directly in your widget tree using **`HeliumFlutter.getUpsellWidget`**:

```dart
class ExamplePageWithEmbeddedPaywall extends StatelessWidget {
  const ExamplePageWithEmbeddedPaywall({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: HeliumFlutter().getUpsellWidget(trigger: 'insert-trigger-here'),
    );
  }
}
```

<Warning>
You'll need to handle dismissal yourself when using this method. Pass in PaywallEventHandlers and use the `onDismissed` handler.
</Warning>

## When to Use These Methods

Use the **ViewModifier or Widget Integration** if you need the paywall to be part of a specific navigation flow or view hierarchy. Use **Explicit Embedding** if you need fine-grained control over the paywall's layout and positioning.

<Info>
For most use cases, `presentUpsell()` is simpler and handles edge cases automatically. See the [iOS](/sdk/quickstart-ios#presenting-paywalls), [Flutter](/sdk/quickstart-flutter#presenting-paywalls), or [React Native](/sdk/quickstart-react-native#presenting-paywalls) quickstart guides for details.
