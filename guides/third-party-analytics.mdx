## Overview

You can configure Helium to automatically send events to your analytics provider or webhook destination of choice.

## About Helium Events

Visit [Helium Events](/sdk/helium-events) to see the full list of events available. We're adding new events often - want support for a new event? Just ask us at support@tryhelium.com

## Automatic event forwarding (recommended)

### Configuration

<Note>
Don't see your analytics provider here, or have a custom setup you want us to send events to? Reach out to founders@tryhelium.com - we might support it under the hood.

    1. Go to [app.tryhelium.com/integrations](https://app.tryhelium.com/integrations). Click **Mixpanel**.
    2. Give your integration a name. There's a few fields to enter due to what Mixpanel's API needs for event ingestion - we're always reducing on simplifying this integration, but the modal will indicate what's needed.
    3. That's it! Paywall events (from local testing or production) will now come into Mixpanel, prefixed with `helium_`. You can view live events by going to the **Events** tab in Mixpanel

    ### User attribution between Helium and Mixpanel

    #### Simplified Identity Merge
    - Mixpanel has a way to do post/pre-login identity stitching via a few methods - with Simplified Identity Merge being the most 
    popular. You can read more about it by visiting [Mixpanel's docs](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified)

    - If you'd like to use simplified identity merge, remember to set the Simplified Identity Merge method to true in the Mixpanel configuration modal.

    #### Overriding the custom user id post login

    - If you're using an anonymous ID pre login, and want to override it to work _post_ login, you can use the `overrideUserId` method (available on all SDKs). View the relevant SDK quickstart for more info!

    - In Mixpanel, Helium events will be prefixed with `helium_`.

<Info>
Helium uses a CDP under the hood to route events. It may take several minutes for events you see on device to populate in your analytics backend.

## Custom forwarding from the SDK

You can also track events from the SDK via the PaywallDelegate or lifecycle methods in each framework. View our SDK quickstarts for more information.
