## Overview

You can configure Helium to automatically send events to your analytics provider or webhook destination of choice.

## About Helium Events

Visit [Helium Events](/sdk/helium-events) to see the full list of events available. We're adding new events often — want support for a new event? Just ask us at support@tryhelium.com

## Automatic event forwarding (recommended)

### Configuration

<Note>
Don't see your analytics provider here, or have a custom setup you want us to send events to? Reach out to founders@tryhelium.com — we might support it under the hood.

    1. Go to [app.tryhelium.com/integrations](https://app.tryhelium.com/integrations). Click **Mixpanel**.
    2. Give your integration a name. There are a few fields to enter due to what Mixpanel's API needs for event ingestion. 
    3.  **Make sure that you have at least Admin or Owner level permissions in Mipxanel, for the project and service accounts**.
    4. That's it! Paywall events (from local testing or production) will now come into Mixpanel, prefixed with `helium_`. You can view live events by going to the **Events** tab in Mixpanel

    ### User attribution between Helium and Mixpanel

    #### Simplified Identity Merge
    - Mixpanel has a way to do post/pre-login identity stitching via a few methods — with Simplified Identity Merge being the most 
    popular. You can read more about it by visiting [Mixpanel's docs](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified)

    - If you'd like to use simplified identity merge, remember to set the Simplified Identity Merge method to true in the Mixpanel configuration modal.

    #### Overriding the custom user id post login

    - If you're using an anonymous ID pre login, and want to override it to work _post_ login, you can use the `overrideUserId` method (available on all SDKs). View the relevant SDK quickstart for more info!

    - In Mixpanel, Helium events will be prefixed with `helium_`.

    2. Give your integration a name. Enter your API key (you can find it under Settings > Projects > [Your Project Name] and grab an API key from there).
    3. That's it! Paywall events will now come into Statsig, prefixed with `helium_`.
    4. Watch events arrive and enjoy analytics in the Statsig UI.

<Info>
Helium uses a CDP under the hood to route events. It may take several minutes for events you see on device to populate in your analytics backend.
</Info>

## What events and properties are logged?

All Helium events, along with their parameters and contextual/custom traits, are automatically forwarded to your analytics backend. For a complete list of events, parameters, and additional context sent with each event, see [Logged Events](/sdk/helium-events#logged-events).

## Custom forwarding from the SDK

You can also track events from the SDK via the PaywallDelegate or lifecycle methods in each framework. View our SDK quickstarts for more information.
