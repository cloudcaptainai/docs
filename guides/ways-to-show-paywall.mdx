## Overview

Most of the time you'll want to use `presentUpsell()` to show paywalls. This approach is covered in each platform's quickstart guide (see navigation menu on the left). But if you need more control over how and where paywalls appear in your app, there are a few other options.

<Warning>
  You'll need to handle loading states, fallback scenarios, and dismissal logic yourself with these methods. We recommend sticking with `presentUpsell()` unless you have a specific reason to use these alternatives.
</Warning>

## iOS
#### SwiftUI ViewModifier

Attach a paywall to any SwiftUI view using the **`.triggerUpsell`** view modifier:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isPresented: Bool = false
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button {
                isPresented = true;
            } label: {
                Text("Show paywall")
            }
        }.triggerUpsell(isPresented: $isPresented, trigger: "post_onboarding")
    }
}
```

  ```swift
  struct ContentView: View {
      @State var isPresented: Bool = false
      var body: some View {
          VStack {
              Button {
                  isPresented = true;
              } label: {
                  Text("Show paywall")
              }
          }
          .triggerUpsell(
              isPresented: $isPresented,
              trigger: "post_onboarding",
              eventHandlers: PaywallEventHandlers()
                  .onOpen { event in
                      print("open via trigger \(event.triggerName)")
                  }
                  .onClose { event in
                      print("close for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
                  }
                  .onDismissed { event in
                      print("dismiss for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
                  }
                  .onPurchaseSucceeded { event in
                      print("purchase made for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
                  }
                  .onCustomPaywallAction { event in
                      print("Custom action: \(event.actionName) with params: \(event.params)")
                  }
          )
      }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

## iOS
#### Explicitly Embedded View

Get the paywall view directly and embed it in your own SwiftUI view hierarchy using **`Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger`**:

```swift
let heliumView: AnyView? = Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger(
    trigger: "post_onboarding"
)
```

<Warning>
  You'll need to handle presentation and dismissal yourself when using this method. You can handle user dismissal with PaywallEventHandlers.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Example with PaywallEventHandlers">
  ```swift
  Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger(
      trigger: "post_onboarding",
      eventHandlers: PaywallEventHandlers()
          .onOpen { event in
              print("open for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
          }
          .onClose { event in
              print("close for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
          }
          .onDismissed { event in
              // handle user dismissal here (i.e. hide the upsell view)
              print("dismiss for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
          }
          .onPurchaseSucceeded { event in
              print("purchase made for trigger \(event.triggerName)")
          }
          .onCustomPaywallAction { event in
              print("Custom action: \(event.actionName) with params: \(event.params)")
          }
  )
  ```
</Accordion>

## Flutter
#### Widget Integration

Embed a paywall directly in your widget tree using **`HeliumFlutter.getUpsellWidget`**:

```dart
class ExamplePageWithEmbeddedPaywall extends StatelessWidget {
  const ExamplePageWithEmbeddedPaywall({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: HeliumFlutter().getUpsellWidget(trigger: 'insert-trigger-here'),
    );
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  You will have to handle your own dismissal. You can do so by passing in PaywallEventHandlers and using the `onDismissed` handler.
</Warning>
