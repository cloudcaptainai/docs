While fallbacks are rare, they do occur on occasion. Make sure you have properly [integrated fallbacks](/guides/fallback-bundle) to ensure you don't miss chances of a paywall conversion!

### Paywall is still downloading

<Info>
  This is the most common reason.
</Info>

Helium fetches your latest paywalls when the Helium SDK is initialized. If a user is on a very slow connection or has no connection at all, a fallback will be shown. Note that by default, a loading state will be shown for a short duration before the fallback is shown. This "loading budget" duration can be configured in the SDKs.

### Paywalls failed to download

Similarly, if user has no connection or a very limited connection, the paywall retrieval may fail entirely. Or if our servers are temporarily down.

### No products associated with paywall for platform

Can occur when a paywall is downloaded but does not have products properly linked for the platform (iOS/Android) it is served to.

### Other Causes

The above are the most common causes, but a fallback can also occur if paywall html is malformed from any other unexpected Helium bug.
