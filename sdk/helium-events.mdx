# Helium Events

Helium SDK emits various events during the lifecycle of paywalls and user interactions. These events can be used for analytics, debugging, and optimizing your paywall strategy.

## Handling Events

You can listen to these events by implementing the `onHeliumPaywallEvent` method in your `HeliumPaywallDelegate`:

```swift
func onHeliumPaywallEvent(event: HeliumPaywallEvent) {
    switch (event) {
    case .paywallOpen(let triggerName, let paywallTemplateName, let viewType):
        print("Paywall opened: \(triggerName), template: \(paywallTemplateName), viewType: \(viewType)")
    case .subscriptionSucceeded(let productKey, let triggerName, let paywallTemplateName):
        print("Subscription succeeded for product: \(productKey)")
    // Handle other events as needed
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

## Event Categories

Helium events are organized into the following categories:

- `triggerName`: The name of the trigger that initiated the paywall.
- `paywallTemplateName`: The name of the paywall template being used.
- `viewType`: How the paywall was displayed. It maps to this enum:

```swift
public enum PaywallOpenViewType : String {
    case presented = "presented" // via presentUpsell
    case triggered = "triggered" // shown via SwiftUI view modifier
    case embedded = "embedded" // paywall was manually embedded
}
```

## Using Events for Analytics

Helium events can be integrated with your existing analytics systems. Here's an example of how you might forward Helium events to your analytics service:

```swift
func onHeliumPaywallEvent(event: HeliumPaywallEvent) {
    // Convert the event to a dictionary
    let eventDict = event.toDictionary()
    
    // Log to your analytics service
    switch event {
    case .subscriptionSucceeded:
        YourAnalyticsService.track(event: "Subscription Completed", properties: eventDict)
    case .paywallOpen:
        YourAnalyticsService.track(event: "Paywall Viewed", properties: eventDict)
    // Add more cases as needed
    default:
        YourAnalyticsService.track(event: "Helium Event: \(event.caseString())", properties: eventDict)
    }
    
    // You can also implement custom business logic based on events
    if case .subscriptionSucceeded = event {
        // Update user properties, unlock premium features, etc.
    }
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

Several Helium events include timing information that can be used to monitor the performance of your paywalls:

- `paywallsDownloadSuccess` includes download times for configurations, images, fonts, and bundles
- `paywallWebViewRendered` includes the time taken to render WebView-based paywalls

You can use this data to identify potential performance issues and optimize the user experience.
