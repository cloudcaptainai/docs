## **Background**

Thanks for getting started with Helium ðŸŽˆ

Helium is an upsell creation and optimization tool for mobile apps. We take your existing paywalls (or help you create new ones!) 
and then we help you turn them into remotely controllable templates that you can edit, experiment, and optimize without waiting
for new app releases. See our [launch post](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/LXq-helium-improve-your-paywall-at-the-speed-of-thought) for more info.

Email founders@tryhelium.com, or text/call @Anish Doshi at any time at 224-770-0305 for any help/questions.

## **How it works**

- You design and build your paywalls in Helium's visual editor (you can import your designs from Figma)
- We'll take in your existing paywalls (or help you migrate them from 3rd party services), and then create handcrafted paywall + upsell screens using best practices we've learned from 10 years of growth product experience @ Uber, Meta, and Apple.
- We provide an SDK that helps you trigger these paywalls from anywhere in your app. Right now, we support iOS (SwiftUI + UIKit), with other frameworks coming very soon.
- We onboard these paywalls into a service that lets you remotely configurate, test, and optimize them. 

## **Installation**

Install **helium-swift** via SPM. In Xcode, go to "Add Package Dependencies", and copy in [`https://github.com/cloudcaptainai/helium-swift`](https://github.com/cloudcaptainai/helium-swift)

Select "Up to next Major Version" with minimum version set to **1.0.0** and maximum set to **2.0.0**

- About this package
    
    **helium-swift** is our open source SDK for iOS, available via SPM. It contains general initialization code that hooks up to our backend, and the view modifier logic.

## Configuration

### Set up your HeliumPaywallDelegate

To integrate Helium paywalls, create a subclass of `HeliumPaywallDelegate`. This class is responsible for handling the purchase logic for your paywalls.
```swift
public protocol HeliumPaywallDelegate: AnyObject {

    // [REQUIRED] - Trigger the purchase of a product with the following App Store Connect Product ID.
    // This method should return a HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus enum, described below.
    // Loading states/UI/UX here gets configured in the Helium dashboard, so this method should just trigger the purchase.
    func makePurchase(productId: String) async -> HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus

    // [OPTIONAL] - Restore any existing subscriptions.
    // This method should return a boolean indicating whether the restore was successful.
    // This method gets called if you've configured a CTA in the editor to restore purchases, which is recommended.
    func restorePurchases() async -> Bool

    // [OPTIONAL] Custom analytics/error logging for paywall/helium
    // related events can be added here.

    // By default, we log events to your analytics service (Amplitude, etc.), but you can override this method to add additional custom logging/handling.
    // For example, you can log failure events to a Sentry instance, or add custom alerts/notifications on certain paywall events here.
    func onHeliumPaywallEvent(event: HeliumPaywallEvent)


    // [OPTIONAL] - Return a dictionary of custom variable values to be used in the paywall.
    // This method should return a dictionary of key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the variable and the value is the value of the variable.
    // These variables can be used to customize the paywall for each user.
    func getCustomVariableValues() -> [String: Any?]
}
```

HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus is an enum that defines the possible states of a paywall transaction.

```swift
import Helium
import HeliumCore

public enum HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus {
    // if the subscription succeeded
    case purchased
    
    // if the subscription was cancelled
    case cancelled
    
    // if the subscription was abandoned
    case abandoned
    
    // if the subscription failed. Pass in the error as an argument for both logging and downstream handling.
    case failed(Error)
    
    // if the user restored their subscription
    case restored
    
    // if the subscription is 'pending' (requires action from developer)
    case pending
}

### Example Delegate:

Here's an example that uses StoreKit's basic Product.purchase() method.

```swift
import Helium
import HeliumCore

class DemoHeliumPaywallDelegate: HeliumPaywallDelegate {
    var subscriptions: [Product]
    
    public init() {
        self.subscriptions = []
        Task {
            do {
                let products = try await Product.products(for: ["yearly_sub_subscription", "monthly_sub_id"])
                self.subscriptions = products
            } catch {
                print("failed to load subscriptions")
            }
        }
    }
    
    func makePurchase(productId: String) async -> HeliumCore.HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus {
        do {
            let result = try await self.subscriptions[1].purchase();
            switch (result) {
                case .success(let result):
                    return .purchased;
                case .userCancelled:
                    return .cancelled;
                case .pending:
                    return .pending
                @unknown default:
                    return .failed(NSError(domain:"", code: 401, userInfo:[ NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Unknown error making purchase"]))
            }
        } catch {
            return .failed(error)
        }
    }

    func getCustomVariableValues() -> [String: Any?] {
        return [
            "userSubscriptionStatus": checkUserSubscriptionStatus(),
            "userIntent": checkUserIntent(),
        ]
    }
}
```

### Initialize Helium and Download Paywall Configs

Somewhere in your app's initialization code (e.g. your `main App` if using SwiftUI, or `AppDelegate` if using ViewController), add the following line to actually download paywall config/variants.
We schedule it on a background thread, so you don't have to worry about it blocking your app's launch time.

```swift
Helium.shared.initialize(
    // you'll get this from Helium founders during setup!
    apiKey: "<your-helium-api-key>",
        
    // The delegate you created earlier.
    heliumPaywallDelegate: YourHeliumPaywallDelegate(),

    // Defines a fallback paywall to show in case the user's device is not connected to the internet.
    fallbackView: (any View)? = nil,

    // If set, a custom user id to use instead of Helium's. (e.g. from your own analytics service)
    customUserId: String? = nil
)
```

Here's a full example, using the demo paywall delegate from above.

```swift
import Helium
import HeliumCore

@main
struct helium_demoApp: App {
    
    init() {
        let delegate = DemoHeliumPaywallDelegate()
        
        Helium.shared.initialize(
            apiKey: "<your-helium-api-key>",
            heliumPaywallDelegate: delegate,
            useCache: true
        )
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Custom user ID

By default, Helium generates a UUID per app session and identifies each user + interaction with this. You can pass override this value with a custom user id (e.g. from a 3rd party analytics service)
by passing it in as a parameter in `Helium.shared.initializeAndFetchVariants`, or by explicitly calling `Helium.shared.overrideUserId`:

```swift
// Somewhere BEFORE initializeAndFetchVariants:
Helium.shared.overrideUserId(newUserId: '<your-custom-user-id>');
```

### Checking Download Status

After the initialization code above runs, you can check the status of the paywall configuration download using the `Helium.shared.downloadStatus()` method. This method returns a value of type `HeliumFetchedConfigStatus`, which is defined as follows:

```swift
public enum HeliumFetchedConfigStatus: Codable {
    case notDownloadedYet
    case downloadSuccess(fetchedConfigId: UUID)
    case downloadFailure
}
```

`notDownloadedYet`: Indicates that the download has not been initiated or is still in progress.

`downloadSuccess(fetchedConfigId: UUID)`: Indicates a successful download. The returned `fetchedConfigID` provides the UUID of the fetched configuration.

`downloadFailure`: Indicates that the download attempt failed.

You can use this to handle different states in your app, for example:
```swift
switch Helium.shared.downloadStatus() {
    case .notDownloadedYet:
        print("Download not started or in progress")
    case .downloadSuccess(let configId):
        print("Download successful with config ID: \(configId)")
    case .downloadFailure:
        print("Download failed")
}
```

## Presenting Paywalls

Now, anywhere in your iOS app, you can use the `triggerUpsell` modifier to (conditionally) trigger a Helium paywall!

- You don't actually specify the paywall version name here - we load the paywall from the backend based on the trigger.
- What *is* specified is a "trigger name". These trigger names should be **unique** across your app. User interactions with paywalls will be tracked and used to optimize the paywall for each trigger.

### Via SwiftUI ViewModifier

You can use the `.triggerUpsell` view modifier from any SwiftUI view. It can be provided with a boolean binding var parameter to control the visibility of the paywall.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isPresented: Bool = false
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button {
                isPresented = true;
            } label: {
                Text("Show paywall")
            }

        }.triggerUpsell(isPresented: $isPresented, trigger: "showPaywallPress")
    }
}
```

### Via Programmatic invokation (UIKit/ViewController)

In addition to using the triggerUpsell modifier, you can also present upsells programmatically using the `presentUpsell(trigger:)` method. This is particularly useful when you need to show a paywall in response to a specific action or event in your app.

```swift
Button("Try Premium") {
    Helium.shared.presentUpsell(trigger: "postOnboardingButtonPress")
}
```

### Explicitly getting the Helium Paywall View

You can also explicitly get the Helium paywall view via `Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger`. This method takes a trigger and returns the paywall
as an `AnyView`. 

```swift
let heliumView: AnyView = Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger(trigger: "postOnboardingButtonPress")
```

### Custom dismissal/navigation actions

By default, Helium uses a `DismissAction` to support dismissing the paywall. However, in cases where you want to control dismissal yourself (e.g. if you're using a custom ViewController, or a NavigationStack), 
you can use `HeliumPaywallDelegate` to wire up dismissal (or any custom action!) events from a given paywall. 

To wire up actions, implement the `onCTAPressed` method as follows:

```swift

class YourHeliumPaywallDelegate: HeliumPaywallDelegate {
    
    func onHeliumPaywallEvent(event: HeliumPaywallEvent) {
        switch (event) {
            case .ctaPressed(let ctaName, let triggerName, let paywallTemplateName): {
                if (ctaName === 'dismiss') {
                    // your custom dismissal action for this trigger
                }
            }
            ... other cases
        }
    }    

    // ...rest of your methods
}
```

How it works is that any component (e.g. an X out icon, decline text, etc.) can be remotely configured to be a wrapped in a `Button` with a name. When this button component
is tapped, we fire the delegate's `onCTAPressed` method with the button name. So, once you've implemented custom swift code from your delegate, you can remotely configure
components in the paywall to trigger those methods.

## Testing

Docs here coming soon! After integration, please message us directly to get set up with a test app.

- `productKey`: Identifies the specific product or subscription tier.
- `triggerName`: Indicates what caused the paywall to be displayed.
- `paywallTemplateName`: Specifies which paywall design template is being used.
